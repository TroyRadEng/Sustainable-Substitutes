# Sustainable-Substitutes
A list of more localized and sustainable replacements for industrial products.

Note: In the Hudson Valley, your USDA hardiness zone varies somewhat based on your proximity to the Hudson River.  This effect is localized enough to vary even within parts of the city.  Check [this map](http://www.plantmaps.com/12180) for your address's hardiness zone.

## Coffee
Much loved but is a tropical plant, often grown in poor countries for the benefit of rich countries. Can we create/blend similar drinks from more native, or at least more locally available plants? Yaupon holly (native to the south) and chicory is a first-order idea. If Yaupon not available immediately maybe we can substitute mate for taste testing.

## Tropical Fruit
Many of the fruits we eat are grown thousands of miles away. But some have cold-hardy alternatives that can grow in Agricultural Zone 5-6 (i.e. the Capital Region).
* Kiwis can be replaced with [hardy kiwifruit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actinidia_arguta)
* Instead of California Almonds, this [hardy variety](https://www.willisorchards.com/product/hall's-hardy-almond-tree) can be grown.
