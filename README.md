# Sustainable-Substitutes
More localized and sustainable replacements for industrial products

## Coffee
Much loved but is a tropical plant, often grown in poor countries for the benefit of rich countries. Can we create/blend similar drinks from more native, or at least more locally available plants? Yaupon holly (native to the south) and chicory is a first-order idea. If Yaupon not available immediately maybe we can substitute mate for taste testing.
